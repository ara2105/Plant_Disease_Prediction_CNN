# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Predictor 

A deep learning-based web application for identifying plant diseases from leaf images.  
## Features

- Image classification for plant disease detection
- User-friendly Streamlit web interface
- Supports multiple plant species
- Mobile-responsive design
- Model trained on PlantVillage dataset

## Dataset

This project uses the [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) from Kaggle containing:
- 38 classes of plant diseases
- Images in color, grayscale, and segmented versions
- Example classes: 
  - Apple Cedar apple rust
  - Corn healthy
  - Tomato Early blight
